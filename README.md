## Updated Daily Caloric Needs Calculation

### 1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Using the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** for men:

$$
\text{BMR} = (10 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (6.25 \times \text{height in cm}) - (5 \times \text{age in years}) + 5
$$

Plugging in your details:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{BMR} &= (10 \times 80) + (6.25 \times 184) - (5 \times 31) + 5 \\
&= 800 + 1,150 - 155 + 5 \\
&= \textbf{1,800\ kcal/day}
\end{align*}
$$

### 2. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

- **Activity Factor**: **1.725** (Very Active)

$$
\text{TDEE} = \text{BMR} \times \text{Activity Factor} = 1,800 \times 1.725 = \textbf{3,105\ kcal/day}
$$

### 3. Adjusted TDEE with Exercise

- **Training Days** (5 days/week):

$$
\text{TDEE} = 3,105\ \text{kcal} + 800\ \text{kcal (training)} = \textbf{3,905\ kcal/day}
$$

- **Cycling Day** (Saturday):

$$
\text{TDEE} = 3,105\ \text{kcal} + 1,421\ \text{kcal (cycling)} = \textbf{4,526\ kcal/day}
$$

- **Rest Day** (Sunday):

$$
\text{TDEE} = \textbf{3,105\ kcal/day}
$$

### 4. Caloric Surplus for Weight Gain

- **Additional Calories**: +500 kcal/day

- **Training Days**:

$$
\text{Daily Caloric Intake} = 3,905\ \text{kcal} + 500\ \text{kcal} = \textbf{4,405\ kcal/day}
$$

- **Cycling Day**:

$$
\text{Daily Caloric Intake} = 4,526\ \text{kcal} + 500\ \text{kcal} = \textbf{5,026\ kcal/day}
$$

- **Rest Day**:

$$
\text{Daily Caloric Intake} = 3,105\ \text{kcal} + 500\ \text{kcal} = \textbf{3,605\ kcal/day}
$$

## Updated Macronutrient Breakdown

### Protein Intake

- **Recommended Intake**: 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kg of body weight
- **Target**: **160 grams per day** (average)
- **Calories from Protein**:

$$
160\ \text{g} \times 4\ \text{kcal/g} = \textbf{640\ kcal/day}
$$

### Fat Intake

- **Percentage of Total Calories**: 25%

#### **Training Days**:

- **Calories from Fat**:

$$
4,405\ \text{kcal} \times 25\% = \textbf{1,101\ kcal}
$$

- **Grams of Fat**:

$$
\frac{1,101\ \text{kcal}}{9\ \text{kcal/g}} \approx \textbf{122\ grams}
$$

#### **Cycling Day**:

- **Calories from Fat**:

$$
5,026\ \text{kcal} \times 25\% = \textbf{1,256.5\ kcal}
$$

- **Grams of Fat**:

$$
\frac{1,256.5\ \text{kcal}}{9\ \text{kcal/g}} \approx \textbf{140\ grams}
$$

#### **Rest Day**:

- **Calories from Fat**:

$$
3,605\ \text{kcal} \times 25\% = \textbf{901.25\ kcal}
$$

- **Grams of Fat**:

$$
\frac{901.25\ \text{kcal}}{9\ \text{kcal/g}} \approx \textbf{100\ grams}
$$

### Carbohydrate Intake

- **Calories Remaining for Carbohydrates**:

#### **Training Days**:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Calories from Carbs} &= 4,405\ \text{kcal} - (640\ \text{kcal (protein)} + 1,101\ \text{kcal (fat)}) \\
&= 4,405\ \text{kcal} - 1,741\ \text{kcal} \\
&= \textbf{2,664\ kcal}
\end{align*}
$$

- **Grams of Carbohydrates**:

$$
\frac{2,664\ \text{kcal}}{4\ \text{kcal/g}} = \textbf{666\ grams}
$$

#### **Cycling Day**:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Calories from Carbs} &= 5,026\ \text{kcal} - (640\ \text{kcal (protein)} + 1,256.5\ \text{kcal (fat)}) \\
&= 5,026\ \text{kcal} - 1,896.5\ \text{kcal} \\
&= \textbf{3,129.5\ kcal}
\end{align*}
$$

- **Grams of Carbohydrates**:

$$
\frac{3,129.5\ \text{kcal}}{4\ \text{kcal/g}} = \textbf{782\ grams}
$$

- **Rest Day**:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Calories from Carbs} &= 3,605\ \text{kcal} - (640\ \text{kcal (protein)} + 901.25\ \text{kcal (fat)}) \\
&= 3,605\ \text{kcal} - 1,541.25\ \text{kcal} \\
&= \textbf{2,063.75\ kcal}
\end{align*}
$$

- **Grams of Carbohydrates**:

$$
\frac{2,063.75\ \text{kcal}}{4\ \text{kcal/g}} = \textbf{516\ grams}
$$
